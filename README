#Thanks for using the Sherlock Bamboo Messaging Plugin!

##DESCRIPTION:
Out of the box, Sherlock will talk to a Rabbit MQ Instance, configured via the spring-context.xml file, located
at src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.

##INSTALLATION:
Install the built jar through Bamboo's web-based plugin management page.
You will most likely need to tweak the `host` property to something other than `localhost`.

Leap for joy when your messages appear in your queue!

##NOTES:
The external `sherlock.properties` config file is not yet active.
